## Introduction

Data sovereignty is a key success factor for data-driven business models. As defined by [Usage Control in International Data Spaces](https://internationaldataspaces.org/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/IDSA-Position-Paper-Usage-Control-in-the-IDS-V3..pdf), data sovereignty has the goal of providing data providers with full control over their data.

Data Usage Control is known as a conceptual and technical solution to cope with the challenges of data sovereignty. Data Usage Control Technologies aim to enforce usage restrictions and obligations once data access is granted.

[MYDATA Control Technologies](https://www.mydata-control.de/) is developed at [Fraunhofer IESE](https://www.iese.fraunhofer.de/en/services/security/datenschutz/my-data-control-technologies.html) as a technical implementation for Data Usage Control. It offers both businesses and private individuals more transparency and self-determination in the use of their data by intercepting events or data flows and enforcing a security decision based on policies. MYDATA Control Technologies can interpret and enforce its own XML-based policy language.

To support users in specifying their policies in the ODRL policy language and translating it into technology-dependent policy languages, a Policy Administration Point and a Policy Transformation Service have been implemented and are available [here](https://odrl-pap.mydata-control.de/).

>NOTE: Through our engagement in IDSA activities, we've developed a draft profile that aligns with the IDS Information Model 4.0, accessible [here](https://docs.internationaldataspaces.org/ids-knowledgebase/v/odrl-profile-for-ids). This effort has resulted in the creation of the ODRL Profile for Data Sovereignty.
